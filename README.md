# Project manager

It is a little command line project manager made in ruby.

## How to use

There are only four commands: ```create```, ```remove```, ```list``` and ```open``` (I didn't found a good way to edit a project).
In the command prompt you just need to go inside the folder that are the files and enter ```projeto``` and the command that you want.

- ```create``` creates a new .md file
- ```remove``` removes an existent .md file
- ```list``` lists all .md files in the current folder
- ```open``` opens a .md file in the terminal
